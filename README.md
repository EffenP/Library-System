# Library-System

A basic library storage system, allows the user to add a book title, author, number of pages and toggle if they have read it or not. The book is then stored locally (with future plans to include DB integration) users can also delete stored books. I have initially used Bootstrap to style the site but i will be coming back to this project to give it a seperate style sheet and remove the bootstrap.


# Todo

- handle multiple of same book being added.


# Future additions

- allow sign in and sign out 
- use firebase to allow signed in useres to save a library to their account.
- CSS overhaul
